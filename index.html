<a id="what-is-shun" class="anchor" href="#what-is-shun" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Shun?</h3>

<p>In August 2015, Mark Tarver, the original creator of the Shen programming language, announced to the mailing list his intention to continue development of the language based on a closed-source commercial model. Given the code was released under a BSD license, we have forked it, and renamed to avoid confusion and trademark complaints. Shun was chosen, as we shun the hoarder ideology of capitalism and follow the GNU way. All our contributions will be published under the LLGPL, thus disallowing extension in dirty commercial systems. The language itself can be used to implement commercial software if you so wish, but the core and its improvements will always require sharing.</p>

<h3>
<a id="modern-development" class="anchor" href="#modern-development" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modern Development</h3>

<p>Shen was unfortunately developed using a model straight out of the 1980s. No version control, DOS encoded files, and releases that are Zip dumps. Shun will be developed in the open, and will use 21st century technologies.</p>

<h3>
<a id="intentional-incompatibility" class="anchor" href="#intentional-incompatibility" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Intentional Incompatibility</h3>

<p>We are not Shen, though we look like it. We do not strive to maintain compatibility going forward, as development is occurring behind closed doors and not for the good of all but for the benefit of few. So, Shun is not Shen.</p>

<h3>
<a id="authors-and-contributors" class="anchor" href="#authors-and-contributors" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Authors and Contributors</h3>

<p>Unlike Shen, you do not have to pay us to submit bug reports. Similarly, we welcome contributions from all, just submit a pull request. We only ask that your contributions be appropriately licensed (LLGPL).</p>
